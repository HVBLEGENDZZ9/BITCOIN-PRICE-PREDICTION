# BITCOIN-PRICE-PREDICTION
 BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION WAS DONE AND EXPERIMENTED USING THE FOLLOWING MODELS:
 * DENSE MODEL (1 WEEK, 1 DAY) : (EPOCHS = 1000)
 * DENSE MODEL (1 MONTH, 1 WEEK) : (EPOCHS = 1000)
 * CONV1D (1 WEEK, 1 DAY) : (EPOCHS = 1000)
 * LSTM (1 WEEK, 1 DAY) : (EPOCHS = 1000)
 * N-BEATS MODEL (1 WEEK, 1 DAY) : (EPOCHS = 5000)
 * ENSEMBLE (1 WEEK, 1 DAY) : (EPOCHS = 1000)
 
 BELOW IS A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE MAE OF ALL THE TESTED MODELS:
